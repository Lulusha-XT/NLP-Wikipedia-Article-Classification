# Wikipedia Article Classification

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook script uses machine learning to classify Wikipedia articles into geographic and non-geographic categories. It fetches content from Wikipedia using the Wikipedia API, preprocesses the text, and trains a logistic regression model for classification.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install requests scikit-learn nltk
```
